# Mythic Plus
Mythic Plus Lua Script I've been working on. This is basically part 1. You can add specific map ids and additional multipliers for low level dungeons. Please also use my spell dbc as it's necessary to apply the correct auras. Run my sql as well. .npc add 90005 in any dungeon or raid that you'd like and select a difficulty from there.
